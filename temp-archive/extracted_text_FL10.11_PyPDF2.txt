EFFECTIVE DATE: 04/24/18 BatchChangeTank Mixing Standard Work for L10 
Night Shift
1.Determine how fast the line is running by taking the starting volume of the current tank, allowing the tank run for 
10 minutes and then recording end volume of that tank. 
2.Subtract the starting volume from the end volume then divide 10. This will give you the speed at which the line is 
running. (Example: (20,000 -17,000) L /10 min = 300 L/min)
3.Repeat this process several times to determine the average speed the line is running.
4.Average times are typically about 300 -350 L/min. 
5.Divide the tank volumes by this number to determine how many minutes the current tanks mixed will last. 
(Example: 39000/300= 130 minutes). 
6.Determine what next tank volumes need to be mixed in order to allow the second to last tank of the batch to be 
completed by 0030. 
7.The second to last tank being empty at 0030 will give mixing adequate time to finish filling and mixing the first 
tank of the nex t batch (It takes mixing at least 1.5 hours to mix the first tank). Batch Change normally begins 
between 02:00 and 02:30. 
8.Recalculate the next tank volumes while second tank is being run to determine if new volumes are needed due to 
downtime. The third/f ourth tank may need to be adjusted if the line has been down long enough.
9.Call mixing when the last tank change is performed or when the tank is completely empty after dumping (This is 
referring to the second to last tank of the current batch).
10.Remember that the Cafeteria Service lasts from 01:00 -03:00; Batch Change has to begin early enough before 
03:00 to give the operators a chance to eat.
11.Excessive downtime can affect when the second to last tank is empty. Be sure to have the tank empty and ready 
formixing by 00:30; 01:00 at the latest. If more than 4200 L are to be dumped, call wastewater (776 -6262) to 
deter mine if that amount of solution waste treatment can handle.

EFFECTIVE DATE: 04/24/18 Go/No Go Gauge for M anual Machines Enhanced Closure Tubing
On Fill Lines 10 and 11, there are LPFs, RPFs, and Manual Fill Machines. On these machines, there are 
enhanced closure feeder bowls and tubing runs from the feeder bowl to the plugging station. The manual 
machines us e tubing stock #655 -00-107 which has an inner diameter of 0.380”. The LPFs and RPFs use 
tubing stock #655 -00-080 with an inner diameter of 0.375”. Because the ID for both types o f tubing is so 
similar and both tubes are clear in co lor, it is very  easy  to m ix up the two. A go/no go gauge has been 
made to improve this problem.
The gauge is labeled wit h the “Manual EC Tubing”
How to Use:
Whenever y ou are repl acing tubing on an enhanced closure feeder bowl, select what y ou believe to be the 
correct tubin g from the m aterial  exchange room .
Place the gauge in to the enhanced closure tubing. 
If the gauge fits easily, y ou have the m anual machine enhanced closure tubing.
If you have to struggl e to fit the gauge in to the tubing, or it will not fit at a ll, you have LPF/RPF 
enhanced closure tubing.
