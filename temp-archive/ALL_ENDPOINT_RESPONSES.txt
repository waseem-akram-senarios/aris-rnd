By enabling machines to better understand and generate human-like language, LLMs have opened new possibilities in the field of AI and impacted entire industries. This book provides a comprehensive and highly visual introduction to the world of LLMs, covering both the conceptual foundations and practical applications. From word representations that preceded deep learning to the cutting-edge (at the time of this writing) Transformer architecture, we will explore the history and evolution of LLMs. We delve into the inner workings of LLMs, exploring their architectures, training methods, and fine-tuning techniques. We also examine various applications of LLMs in text classification, clustering, topic modeling, chatbots, search engines, and more. With its unique blend of intuition-building, applications, and illustrative to explore the exciting world of LLMs. Whether you are a beginner or an style, we hope that this book provides the ideal foundation for those looking expert, we invite you to join us on this journey to start building with LLMs.\n\n## An Intuition-First Philosophy\n\nThe main goal of this book is to provide an intuition into the field of LLMs. The pace of development in the Language AI field is incredibly fast and frustration can build trying to keep up with the latest technologies. Instead, we focus on the fundamentals of LLMs and intend to provide a fun and easy learning process. To achieve this intuition-first philosophy we liberally make use of visual language. Illustrations will help give a visual identity to major concepts and processes involved in the learning process of LLMs. 1 With our illustrative method of storytelling, we want to take you on a journey to this exciting and potentially world-changing field. Throughout the book, we make a clear distinction between representation and generative language models. Representation models are LLMs that do not generate text but are commonly used for task-specific use cases, like classification, whereas generation models are LLMs that generate text, like GPT models. Although generative models are typically the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about LLMs, there is still much use for representation models. We are also loosely using the word 'large' in large language models and often elect to simply call them language models as size descriptions are often rather arbitrary and not always indicative of capability.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThis book assumes that you have some experience programming in Python and are familiar with the fundamentals of machine learning. The focus will be on building a strong intuition rather than deriving mathematical equations. As such, illustrations combined with hands-on examples will drive the examples and learning through this book. This book assumes no prior knowledge of popular deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow nor any prior knowledge of generative modeling. If you are not familiar with Python, a great place to start is Learn Python, where you will find many tutorials on the basics of the language. To further ease the learning process, we made all the code available on Google Colab, a platform where you can run all of the code without the need to install anything locally.\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n\n## Book Structure\n\nThe book is broadly divided into three parts. They are illustrated in Figure P-1 to give you a full view of the book. Note that each chapter",
