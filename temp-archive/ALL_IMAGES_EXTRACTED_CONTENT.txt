## Line 10 'Fill Side' Batch Change Standard Work

## External

-  Verify imprint station is setup with old batch BOM, setup sheet, imprint board and / or calibrated ruler.
-  Get heat resistant gloves, drill and drill extension for imprint station.
-  Get type box for LPF once the new batch BOM / setup sheet has been locked in box.

--- Page 3 ---
-  Get barcode cords plugged in and ready (only if changing codes).
-  Get manifolds and assure tubing is in good working condition.
-  Keep rework bin cleaned out.
-  The handler that performs the last tank change of the batch will call the Chem Lab and notify them that we are in our last tank, (this is an Opti-Lab requirement).
-  The handler that performs the last quality check of the batch will close old batch out in SPC system.
-  Perform FOB checks and document in fill / pack.

## Internal

-  Cycle stop machine, turn accumulator off, use clear machine function and let machine clear out until last pattern of bags are above nozzles or at end of barcode station. Cycle stop machine, use clear machine function in Imprint Mode. Cycle stop / E-stop LPF after removing the last pattern of unfilled printed bags from end of LPF conveyor which will be used as EOB imprints.
-  Handlers obtain EOB imprints, check and sign.
-  Place BOM / setup sheets &amp; EOB imprints in old batch folder (after last imprints are pulled and signed).
-  Move the fill station downhill away from barcode station if applicable, to get LPF ready to flush.
-  Remove old type from the die plate and lock it up in the type removed side of the type box. Once the old type is locked up, unlock the type to be installed side of the box.
-  Proceed to the unload station between LPF02 &amp; LPF03. Line Clearance can begin when all handlers are present. Maintain proper interval during clearance. Perform line clearance on LPF02 &amp; LPF01. Document clearance in Fill / Pack.
-  As soon as the Clearance is complete, disengage E-Stops and push machine reset to clear all fault messages. On the HMI screen 'select' clear machine, mode of operation-automatic, accumulator on, imprint mode enabled than 'select' clear entire machine. Run machine (8 cycles) until printed, unfilled bags are one cycle past the fill station. Cycle stop the machine and depress the E-Stop. Remove the set of bags that are past the fill station (close clamps) for FOB Imprints, check and sign if acceptable.
-  Install manifold / verify air inject air lines are removed (manual nozzle also).
-  Perform FOB flush if not previously performed (for FOB flush, machines must be flushed in sequence). Ensure flush gets documented in fill/pack.
-  Remove flush manifold and hook up air inject air lines (manual nozzle also).
-  When all machines have completed the flush, start LPF and pull FOB samples while belt is running, place in sample cart.

## Operators


--- Page 4 ---
-  Operators help handler obtain EOB imprints.
-  Operators remove used hot stamp and barcode foil (used hot stamp foil is placed on foil cart and used barcode foil is placed in trash).
-  Verify reject bins are empty and rejects are cut.
-  Take filling and pouching trash to appropriate pouching side door.
-  Perform Zone Clearance.

## Batch Change Tank Mixing Standard Work for L10 Night Shift

1. Determine how fast the line is running by taking the starting volume of the current tank, allowing the tank run for 10 minutes and then recording end volume of that tank.
2. Subtract the starting volume from the end volume then divide 10. This will give you the speed at which the line is running. (Example: (20,000-17,000) L /10 min = 300 L/min)
3. Repeat this process several times to determine the average speed the line is running.
4. Average times are typically about 300-350 L/min.
5. Divide the tank volumes by this number to determine how many minutes the current tanks mixed will last. (Example: 39000/300= 130 minutes).
6. Determine what next tank volumes need to be mixed in order to allow the second to last tank of the batch to be completed by 0030.
7. The second to last tank being empty at 0030 will give mixing adequate time to finish filling and mixing the first tank of the next batch (It takes mixing at least 1.5 hours to mix the first tank). Batch Change normally begins between 02:00 and 02:30.
8. Recalculate the next tank volumes while second tank is being run to determine if new volumes are needed due to downtime. The third/fourth tank may need to be adjusted if the line has been down long enough.
9. Call mixing when the last tank change is performed or when the tank is completely empty after dumping (This is referring to the second to last tank of the current batch).
10. Remember that the Cafeteria Service lasts from 01:00-03:00; Batch Change has to begin early enough before 03:00 to give the operators a chance to eat.
11. Excessive downtime can affect when the second to last tank is empty. Be sure to have the tank empty and ready for mixing by 00:30; 01:00 at the latest. If more than 4200 L are to be dumped, call wastewater (776-6262) to determine if that amount of solution waste treatment can handle.

## Line 10 Parts Kanban Standard Work


--- Page 41 ---
The parts Kanban has been provided to allow easier access to replacement parts that are the most commonly used on LPFs. This will enable Mechanics and PT/ Handlers to avoid downtime associated with searching for parts. This Kanban has been clearly labeled with part names and numbers and organized such that parts can be found, used, and replaced easily. Handler has been assigned days of the week that they are responsible for checking the Kanban parts cabinet and restocking. It is the responsibility of that PT/SR handler to check for needed parts and replace as needed.

-  Saturdays: 5 th and 7 th

will check and replace parts as needed.

-  Wednesdays: 6 th and 8 th will check and replace parts as needed.

## How to Use:

Whenever you are replacing tubing on an enhanced closure feeder bowl, select what you believe to be the correct tubing from the material exchange room.

Place the gauge in to the enhanced closure tubing.

-  If the gauge fits easily, you have the manual machine enhanced closure tubing.
-  If you have to struggle to fit the gauge in to the tubing, or it will not fit at all, you have LPF/RPF enhanced closure tubing.

## Go/No Go Gauge for Manual Machines Enhanced Closure Tubing

On Fill Lines 10 and 11, there are LPFs, RPFs, and Manual Fill Machines. On these machines, there are enhanced closure feeder bowls and tubing runs from the feeder bowl to the plugging station. The manual machines use tubing stock #655-00-107 which has an inner diameter of 0.380'. The LPFs and RPFs use tubing stock #655-00-080 with an inner diameter of 0.375'. Because the ID for both types of tubing is so similar and both tubes are clear in color, it is very easy to mix up the two. A go/no go gauge has been made to improve this problem.

The gauge is labeled with the 'Manual EC Tubing'


--- Page 43 ---
If your first tubing choice doesn't match the machine that you want to put it on, test another roll of tubing until you find the correct one.

*Note: If this gauge is ever lost or damaged, it will be set up as a stock item and can be found in the stock room.

## Lockout for Solution Pump Standard Work

Description: To allow the Solution Transmission System to be safely opened when a break in fill line occurs behind the shut off valve or the break affects the shut off valve itself.

This is not a lockout procedure to be used for making any kind of electrical repairs. Lockout /Tagout per plant safety procedures should be followed and lockout/ tagout should be performed by authorized individuals only .

When to Lockout Pump: The pump should be locked out anytime solution cannot be shut off with a divert valve or cutoff valve that is a part of the Solution Transmission System or for pump repairs.

Why: Solution pump lockout is performed to prevent the solution pump from being accidentally turned back on while the solution transmission system is open.

## How:

1. Stop the solution pump by pressing the red stop button located on the control panel that houses the tank controls.

--- Page 44 ---
2. Place the switch located at the pump plug receptacle to the OFF position.
3. Once the switch is in the OFF position, place a lock on the switch assuring the lock is closed completely. (Locks can be attained from the Maintenance Department).
4. The solution line can now be safely opened. Always follow correct procedures in the applicable Standard Operating Procedure for the type of break in fill line that is performed. Reference the applicable SOP for solution flushes and sampling required.
5. Once repairs are completed and the solution line is closed, the person who placed the lock on the switch may now remove the lock and turn the switch back to the ON position and restart the solution pump.

## Maintenance, Flush and Sampling Notification

During daily production unscheduled maintenance activities or scheduled preventative maintenance may occur. It is the responsibility of the production handler/ production tech. (PT) to assure that the appropriate machine flush, sampling and follow-up testing is performed per appropriate procedure in each instance. If maintenance is performed by a mechanic then the production handler or PT should be notified of the activities prior to restart of the equipment. To aide in this process Communication Placards must be placed at the load stations of each affected piece of equipment when these activities occur. The following will give a general outline for placard use. Any additional situations that may occur should directed to the line supervisor or delegate.

-  40 Micron Mesh Screen Preventive Maintenance (PM) is scheduled to be performed : Once production has finished on the piece of equipment the placard 'Stop. BFL Flush and Samples Required' should be placed at the designated location at the load station.
-  Monthly Machine Maintnenace (PM) is scheduled to be performed : Once production has finished on the piece of equipment the placard 'Stop. Maintenance of Equipment Performed. Follow-up Testing Required'.
-  Unscheduled maintenance (emergency maintenance) or equipment adjustments : At the time is equipment is cycle stopped or cleared of units the placard 'Stop. Maintenance of Equipment Performed. Follow-up Testing Required'.

At the completion of machine flush, sampling and/or follow-up testing the placard will be removed and placed at the designated placard storage area for each machine.
