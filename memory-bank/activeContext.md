## Open decisions
- Should guardrails be enabled by default via a config flag (e.g., `GUARDRAILS_DEFAULT=true`) and overridable per request?
- Model selection defaults: clarify and document supported model IDs for Bedrock
- Authentication strategy for MCP servers in production (currently using simple API keys)

## Next steps (proposed)

  - Storage abstraction for document status (DynamoDB + PostgreSQL option)
  - Configuration system (YAML-based) for vector stores, embeddings, chunking
  - Document Processor ECS service (S3 → chunks → S3 staging)
  - Vector Indexer ECS service (chunks → embeddings → vector store)
  - Ingestion trigger Lambda (Function URL API)
  - CDK infrastructure stack (ECS, SQS, DynamoDB, networking)
  - LocalStack docker-compose for local development
  - Update RAG MCP server tools (ingest_document, get_document_status, search)
- **Agent Evolution**
  - Migrate additional tools from old agent implementation using core libraries
  - Add unit tests for core libraries (memory management, file processing, MCP servers)
  - Implement real API endpoints beyond fake data (machine details, production summaries)
  - Add config-level guardrails default and server-side override rules
- **Infrastructure & Production**
  - Flesh out `AgentStack` with ECS/ALB and secret wiring; add CI/CD pipeline
  - Implement more sophisticated MCP server authentication (JWT, mTLS)
