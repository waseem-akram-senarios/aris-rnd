## Maintenance, Flush and Sampling Notification

During daily production unscheduled maintenance activities or scheduled preventative maintenance may occur. It is the responsibility of the production handler/ production tech. (PT) to assure that the appropriate machine flush, sampling and follow-up testing is performed per appropriate procedure in each instance. If maintenance is performed by a mechanic then the production handler or PT should be notified of the activities prior to restart of the equipment. To aide in this process Communication Placards must be placed at the load stations of each affected piece of equipment when these activities occur. The following will give a general outline for placard use. Any additional situations that may occur should directed to the line supervisor or delegate.

-  40 Micron Mesh Screen Preventive Maintenance (PM) is scheduled to be performed : Once production has finished on the piece of equipment the placard 'Stop. BFL Flush and Samples Required' should be placed at the designated location at the load station.
-  Monthly Machine Maintnenace (PM) is scheduled to be performed : Once production has finished on the piece of equipment the placard 'Stop. Maintenance of Equipment Performed. Follow-up Testing Required'.
-  Unscheduled maintenance (emergency maintenance) or equipment adjustments : At the time is equipment is cycle stopped or cleared of units the placard 'Stop. Maintenance of Equipment Performed. Follow-up Testing Required'.
