-  Place BOM / setup sheets &amp; EOB imprints in old batch folder (after last imprints are pulled and signed).
-  Move the fill station downhill away from barcode station if applicable, to get LPF ready to flush.
-  Remove old type from the die plate and lock it up in the type removed side of the type box. Once the old type is locked up, unlock the type to be installed side of the box.
-  Proceed to the unload station between LPF02 &amp; LPF03. Line Clearance can begin when all handlers are present. Maintain proper interval during clearance. Perform line clearance on LPF02 &amp; LPF01. Document clearance in Fill / Pack.
-  As soon as the Clearance is complete, disengage E-Stops and push machine reset to clear all fault messages. On the HMI screen 'select' clear machine, mode of operation-automatic, accumulator on, imprint mode enabled than 'select' clear entire machine. Run machine (8 cycles) until printed, unfilled bags are one cycle past the fill station. Cycle stop the machine and depress the E-Stop. Remove the set of bags that are past the fill station (close clamps) for FOB Imprints, check and sign if acceptable.
-  Install manifold / verify air inject air lines are removed (manual nozzle also).
-  Perform FOB flush if not previously performed (for FOB flush, machines must be flushed in sequence). Ensure flush gets documented in fill/pack.
-  Remove flush manifold and hook up air inject air lines (manual nozzle also).
-  When all machines have completed the flush, start LPF and pull FOB samples while belt is running, place in sample cart.

## Operators


--- Page 4 ---
-  Operators help handler obtain EOB imprints.
-  Operators remove used hot stamp and barcode foil (used hot stamp foil is placed on foil cart and used barcode foil is placed in trash).
-  Verify reject bins are empty and rejects are cut.

## (Filter Test)

-  Set up filter test site as instructed in the filter certification training.
-  Get measuring rod from Vat, (# on Rod should match # on surge tank) rinse it off and place it on the filter cart.

-  If testing filters, take off cartridge filter and put on water per SOP. If replacing filters, remove the old prefilter and cartridge filter and install new filters as long as you are not hooked to the surge tank.
-  When samples have been pulled, turn off discharge pumps and verify the amount of solution left in the surge tank and drain.
-  Go inside and enter tank unhook and EOB solution loss in fill pack (mix tank, surge tank and piping).
-  Enter any remaining scrap if necessary than change fill/pack over to new batch.
-  Once on new batch, select fill point setup than select new tank which will print your addressograph ticket.
-  Return to the tank room, Verify surge tank is empty, hang measuring rod inside surge tank and close surge tank valve.
-  Test and reinstall cartridge filter or remove old multiplate filters and install new multiplate filters. Reconnect cartridge filter to surge tank (make sure all hoke valves are open).
-  Have second person verify tank hook up. Perform tank valve flush and cap off tank valve per SOP.
-  Open tank valve and header box. Record time in use on prefilter and cartridge filter tags per SOP.
-  Turn supply pump on and do surge tank flush per SOP. Drain surge tank and remove measuring rod.
-  Verify surge tank is empty, close and lock lid, close surge tank valve and start refilling surge tank.
-  Record time in use on new multiplate filter tags per SOP. Once solution is coming through the hoke valves, close valves half way before turning on discharge pumps.
-  Once solution starts coming through hoke valves notify inside to put manifolds on LPF's.
-  Once surge tank is about half full notify inside to flush machines.

## Batch Change Tank Mixing Standard Work for L10 Night Shift

1. Determine how fast the line is running by taking the starting volume of the current tank, allowing the tank run for 10 minutes and then recording end volume of that tank.
2. Subtract the starting volume from the end volume then divide 10. This will give you the speed at which the line is running. (Example: (20,000-17,000) L /10 min = 300 L/min)
3. Repeat this process several times to determine the average speed the line is running.
4. Average times are typically about 300-350 L/min.
5. Divide the tank volumes by this number to determine how many minutes the current tanks mixed will last. (Example: 39000/300= 130 minutes).
6. Determine what next tank volumes need to be mixed in order to allow the second to last tank of the batch to be completed by 0030.
7. The second to last tank being empty at 0030 will give mixing adequate time to finish filling and mixing the first tank of the next batch (It takes mixing at least 1.5 hours to mix the first tank). Batch Change normally begins between 02:00 and 02:30.
8. Recalculate the next tank volumes while second tank is being run to determine if new volumes are needed due to downtime. The third/fourth tank may need to be adjusted if the line has been down long enough.
9. Call mixing when the last tank change is performed or when the tank is completely empty after dumping (This is referring to the second to last tank of the current batch).
10. Remember that the Cafeteria Service lasts from 01:00-03:00; Batch Change has to begin early enough before 03:00 to give the operators a chance to eat.
11. Excessive downtime can affect when the second to last tank is empty. Be sure to have the tank empty and ready for mixing by 00:30; 01:00 at the latest. If more than 4200 L are to be dumped, call wastewater (776-6262) to determine if that amount of solution waste treatment can handle.
