Determine how fast the line is running by taking the starting volume of the current tank, allowing the tank run for 10 minutes and then recording end volume of that tank.\n2. Subtract the starting volume from the end volume then divide 10. This will give you the speed at which the line is running. (Example: (20,000-17,000) L /10 min = 300 L/min)\n3. Repeat this process several times to determine the average speed the line is running.\n4. Average times are typically about 300-350 L/min.\n5. Divide the tank volumes by this number to determine how many minutes the current tanks mixed will last. (Example: 39000/300= 130 minutes).\n6. Determine what next tank volumes need to be mixed in order to allow the second to last tank of the batch to be completed by 0030.\n7. The second to last tank being empty at 0030 will give mixing adequate time to finish filling and mixing the first tank of the next batch (It takes mixing at least 1.5 hours to mix the first tank). Batch Change normally begins between 02:00 and 02:30.\n8. Recalculate the next tank volumes while second tank is being run to determine if new volumes are needed due to downtime. The third/fourth tank may need to be adjusted if the line has been down long enough.\n9. Call mixing when the last tank change is performed or when the tank is completely empty after dumping (This is referring to the second to last tank of the current batch).\n10. Remember that the Cafeteria Service lasts from 01:00-03:00; Batch Change has to begin early enough before 03:00 to give the operators a chance to eat.\n11. Excessive downtime can affect when the second to last tank is empty. Be sure to have the tank empty and ready for mixing by 00:30; 01:00 at the latest. If more than 4200 L are to be dumped, call wastewater (776-6262) to determine if that amount of solution waste treatment can handle.\n\n## FOR INFORMATION ONLY - MAY BE DISCARDED\n\nDOCUMENT OWNER:  N.

On these machines, there are enhanced closure feeder bowls and tubing runs from the feeder bowl to the plugging station. The manual machines use tubing stock #655-00-107 which has an inner diameter of 0.380'. The LPFs and RPFs use tubing stock #655-00-080 with an inner diameter of 0.375'. Because the ID for both types of tubing is so similar and both tubes are clear in color, it is very easy to mix up the two. A go/no go gauge has been made to improve this problem.\n\nThe gauge is labeled with the 'Manual EC Tubing'\n\n\n--- Page 43 ---\nIf your first tubing choice doesn't match the machine that you want to put it on, test another roll of tubing until you find the correct one.\n\n*Note: If this gauge is ever lost or damaged, it will be set up as a stock item and can be found in the stock room.\n\nPARENT: FILL LINES 10 &amp; 11 SPECIFIC\n\nFL10.11 SPECIFIC8\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE: 04/24/18\n\n## Lockout for Solution Pump Standard Work\n\nDescription: To allow the Solution Transmission System to be safely opened when a break in fill line occurs behind the shut off valve or the break affects the shut off valve itself.\n\nThis is not a lockout procedure to be used for making any kind of electrical repairs. Lockout /Tagout per plant safety procedures should be followed and lockout/ tagout should be performed by authorized individuals only .\n\nWhen to Lockout Pump: The pump should be locked out anytime solution cannot be shut off with a divert valve or cutoff valve that is a part of the Solution Transmission System or for pump repairs.\n\nWhy: Solution pump lockout is performed to prevent the solution pump from being accidentally turned back on while the solution transmission system is open.\n\n## How:\n\n1. Stop the solution pump by pressing the red stop button located on the control panel that houses the tank controls.\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n2. Place the switch located at the pump plug receptacle to the OFF position.\n3. Once the switch is in the OFF position, place a lock on the switch assuring the lock is closed completely. (Locks can be attained from the Maintenance Department).\n4. The solution line can now be safely opened. Always follow correct procedures in the applicable Standard Operating Procedure for the type of break in fill line that is performed. Reference the applicable SOP for solution flushes and sampling required.\n5. Once repairs are completed and the solution line is closed, the person who placed the lock on the switch may now remove the lock and turn the switch back to the ON position and restart the solution pump.\n\nPARENT: FILL LINES 10 &amp; 11 SPECIFIC\n\nFL10.11 SPECIFIC8\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE: 04/24/18\n\n## Standard Work for Rework % Reduction\n\n1. Record at start of shift the filling, plugging, and rework percentages on LPF/RPF Report Worksheet\n2. Continue to record data approximately every 2 hours (i.e. Quality Check).\n3. If any filling, plugging, and/or rework percentages are not moving toward the goal of filling / plugging at or above 99% and rework at 3.00%, notify Line Supervisor and/or Maintenance immediately.\n4. If percentages continue to not meet goal notify Line Supervisor and they will notify Maintenance Supervisor and Manufacturing Superintendent.\n5. During the shift, if the filling, plugging, and/or rework percentage does not drive a favorable movement toward goal the issue will be escalated to the Shift Superintendent/Focus Force Team.\n\nPARENT: FILL LINES 10 &amp; 11 SPECIFIC\n\nFL10.11 SPECIFIC8\n\n\n--- Page 45 ---\nEFFECTIVE DATE: 04/24/18\n\n## Cyclohex Dispensing Standard Work\n\nPPE Available At Point Of Use\n\nPump Drum Before Dispensing\n\nEmployee wearing PPE and properly dispensing cyclohex\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE: 04/24/18\n\nPARENT: FILL LINES 10 &amp; 11 SPECIFIC PAGE 43 OF 49 FL10.11 SPECIFIC8 FOR INFORMATION ONLY-MAY BE DISCARDED                                                                                             DOCUMENT OWNER: TIM MARINI 1 COPY POSTED IN SOUTH GARB ROOM\n\n## Line 11 Piping Verification Talley Sheet Print 'DWH :\n\n| Mix Tank to Surge Tank                         | A-B              | B-C            |                 |          |          |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------|----------|\n| Totals Surge Tank to Filter Leg 1 (P1)         | I-Z (3')         | Z-(P1 In) (3') | (P1 Out)-N (2') | R-S (3') | S-X (3') |\n| Totals                                         |                  |                |                 |          |          |\n| Surge Tank to Filter Leg 2 (P1)                | I-Z (3')         | Z-(P1 In) (3') | (P1 Out)-O (2') | P-W (3') |          |\n| Totals                                         |                  |                |                 |          |          |\n| Filter Leg 1: LPF5, LPF7& Manual Filler E-belt | LPF5 U-LPF5 (2') |                |                 |          |          |\n\n--- Page 46 ---\n\nPARENT: FILL LINES 10 &amp; 11 SPECIFIC\n\nFL10.11 SPECIFIC8\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE: 04/24/18\n\n| Print 'DWH :                   |                               |                |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|\n| Total                          |                               |                |\n|                                | LPF7 S-Y (2')                 | Y- LPF7 (1.5') |\n| Total                          | Manual Belt X-Filler E (1.5') |                |\n| Total                          |                               |                |\n| Filter Leg 2: LPF6, RPF2& RPF1 | LPF6 Q-V (2')                 | V-LPF6 (1.5')  |\n| Total                          |                               |                |\n|                                | RPF2 T-RPF2 (2')              |                |",

It is the responsibility of the production handler/ production tech. (PT) to assure that the appropriate machine flush, sampling and follow-up testing is performed per appropriate procedure in each instance. If maintenance is performed by a mechanic then the production handler or PT should be notified of the activities prior to restart of the equipment. To aide in this process Communication Placards must be placed at the load stations of each affected piece of equipment when these activities occur. The following will give a general outline for placard use. Any additional situations that may occur should directed to the line supervisor or delegate.\n\n-  40 Micron Mesh Screen Preventive Maintenance (PM) is scheduled to be performed : Once production has finished on the piece of equipment the placard 'Stop. BFL Flush and Samples Required' should be placed at the designated location at the load station.\n-  Monthly Machine Maintnenace (PM) is scheduled to be performed : Once production has finished on the piece of equipment the placard 'Stop. Maintenance of Equipment Performed. Follow-up Testing Required'.\n-  Unscheduled maintenance (emergency maintenance) or equipment adjustments : At the time is equipment is cycle stopped or cleared of units the placard 'Stop. Maintenance of Equipment Performed. Follow-up Testing Required'.\n\nAt the completion of machine flush, sampling and/or follow-up testing the placard will be removed and placed at the designated placard storage area for each machine.\n\nPARENT: FILL LINES 10 &amp; 11 SPECIFIC\n\nFL10.11 SPECIFIC8\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE: 04/24/18",
