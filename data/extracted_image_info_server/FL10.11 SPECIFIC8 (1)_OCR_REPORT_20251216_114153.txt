SEARCH FOR SPECIFIC ITEMS
======================================================================

'mallet': 0 occurrence(s)

'wrench': 25 occurrence(s)
  Found in images: [7]

'socket': 6 occurrence(s)
  Found in images: [7]

'ratchet': 1 occurrence(s)
  Found in images: [7]

'drawer': 5 occurrence(s)
  Found in images: [7]

'tool': 13 occurrence(s)
  Found in images: [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13]

'part': 21 occurrence(s)
  Found in images: [5, 9, 13]

======================================================================
DETAILED 'MALLET' SEARCH
======================================================================

❌ 'mallet' NOT found in marked image sections

❌ 'mallet' NOT found anywhere in extracted text

Possible reasons:
  1. OCR didn't recognize it (image quality issue)
  2. It's spelled differently in the image
  3. It's in an image that returned empty OCR result

======================================================================
HOW RAG SYSTEM PROCESSES THIS
======================================================================

1. Docling extracts text and inserts <!-- image --> markers
   → 13 markers inserted for 22 images (59.1% coverage)

2. RAG system finds chunks with <!-- image --> markers
   → Will find 13 image sections

3. RAG extracts OCR text after each marker
   → Total OCR text available: 105,667 characters

4. RAG creates image_content_map structure
   → Maps (source, image_num) to OCR content

5. RAG adds Image Content section to LLM context
   → LLM can search this section for tool/item names

6. When user asks 'Where can I find the Mallet?':
   → ❌ Mallet NOT in Image Content section (not in marked images)
   → Need to improve marker insertion or search all text
