Subject: OpenSearch Permissions Request - RAG Project

Hi,

I need OpenSearch permissions for my RAG system project. Currently I can only list/describe domains but cannot create indices or perform data operations.

Missing Permissions:
- cluster:monitor/main
- indices:admin/create
- indices:admin/get
- indices:data/write/index
- indices:data/read/search

My Details:
IAM User: WaseemOS
IAM ARN: arn:aws:iam::975049910508:user/WaseemOS
Domain: intelycx-os-dev

Please map my IAM user to an OpenSearch role with these permissions. The domain uses FGAC, so I need OpenSearch-level role mapping.

Thanks!
