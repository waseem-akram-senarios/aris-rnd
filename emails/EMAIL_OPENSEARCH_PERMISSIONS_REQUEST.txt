Subject: OpenSearch Permissions Request for RAG System Project

Hi [Administrator Name],

I'm working on a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system project that requires OpenSearch integration. I need additional OpenSearch permissions to complete the implementation.

Current Status:
----------------
✅ I currently have:
   - AWS API: list_domain_names (can list OpenSearch domains)
   - AWS API: describe_domain (can get domain information)

❌ I'm missing:
   - cluster:monitor/main (basic cluster access - needed for authentication)
   - indices:admin/create (create indices for document storage)
   - indices:admin/get (list and get index information)
   - indices:data/write/index (write documents to indices)
   - indices:data/read/search (search documents for RAG queries)

My Details:
-----------
IAM User: WaseemOS
IAM ARN: arn:aws:iam::975049910508:user/WaseemOS
OpenSearch Domain: intelycx-os-dev
Region: us-east-2

Request:
--------
Please map my IAM user to an OpenSearch role with the following permissions:
   • cluster:monitor/main
   • indices:admin/create
   • indices:admin/get
   • indices:admin/mapping/get
   • indices:data/write/index
   • indices:data/write/bulk
   • indices:data/read/search
   • indices:data/read/get

These permissions are required for:
   - Creating indices to store document embeddings
   - Writing processed documents to OpenSearch
   - Searching documents for the RAG query system

The domain uses Fine-Grained Access Control (FGAC), so I need to be added to an OpenSearch role within the domain, not just IAM policies.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there are any concerns.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
